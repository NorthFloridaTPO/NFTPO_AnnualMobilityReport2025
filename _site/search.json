According to data from the FDOT state materials office, a pavement condition survey program showed that for 2023, District 2 had 72.7% of SHS pavement meeting FDOT standards. The North Florida TPO area has data from as recent as 2022. For 2022, the percentage of interstate pavement in poor condition was 0.2% which is an improvement of 0.1% from the previous year. The percentage of non-interstate NHS pavement in poor condition was 1.6% which was about the same as the previous year."

Pavement condition is summarized for Interstate and non-Interstate facilities that are on the National Highway System (NHS). The % is based on the lane-miles of facilities. Bridges are summarized by NHS and non-NHS facilities. The percent is calculated based on the bridge deck area. Goals are set by FDOT for how much of each category is in good condition and how much is in poor condition. Table 10 summarizes the pavement conditions."

    "text": "7.4 Transit Vehicles\nMaintaining transit vehicles and systems in a state of good repair is one of the highest priorities for any transit system to ensure safe, dependable and accessible services are provided.\nThe average age of vehicles operated by the Jacksonville Transportation Authority and Nassau Council on aging increased from 2019 with limited fleet replacement (0.3-year average increase) for each. The Sunshine Bus Company replaced a vehicle and their average age decreased.\nThe Jacksonville Transportation Authority assumed the operations of Clay Transit in 2018 and those vehicles are shown as part of the Jacksonville Transportation Authority’s fleet beginning in 2018.\nThe service life for transit vehicles varies by type and is not analyzed as part of this report. Most buses have a service life of 12 years or 250,000 miles. Smaller buses, such as shuttles, have a service life of four to seven years and between 50,000 and 175,000 miles. The people mover vehicles on the Automated Skyway Express in downtown Jacksonville exceed their predicted service life. The vehicles are currently 21 years old. A Skyway Modernization Program is underway.\nThe Mayport Ferry vessel, the Jean Ribault, has been carrying vehicles and people for 24 years, but is in good state of repair. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority assumed operations of the ferry from the City of Jacksonville in 2016."

The external costs included, or those not paid directly by the traveler, are from emissions which result in additional health care costs caused from increase cancer rates, loss of earnings associated with them and the associated negative health impacts. The costs of climate change associated with greenhouse gas emissions from carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen are also included. Emissions account for &lt;1% of the social costs of congestion.\nThe social cost of congested increased about 11% in 2022 compared to 2021 and has risen above pre-pandemic levels.\nThere is no target for the social cost of congestion but the costs should maintain or decline each year."

The cost of serious injury crashes has decreased since 2021.\nThe target is to have zero injuries or fatalities resulting from crashes."

The Florida Department of Transportation will invest $1.4 billion in Clay, Duval, Nassau and St. Johns counties in the 2022-2023 Work Program resulting in an economic benefit of $5.8 billion. The 2022-2023 fiscal year work program is the largest investment in history.\nMultimodal\nNorth Florida’s ports generate 138,500 jobs in Florida and supports nearly $31.1 billion in annual economic output for the region and state. Jacksonville Aviation Authority’s four-airport system contributes more than $6 billion annually to the local economy. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority’s operations generated more than $73.6 million in labor compensation, saved customers more than $23.4 million in transportation costs, and spurred $118.6 million in total added value. The total benefit for transportation investment is $40.4 billion for North Florida.\nThere are no benchmarks for the economic benefit, but the larger the benefit the better."
